# word-guess-game

The assigned task for this repository was to create a hangman game using JavaScript. The assignment requirements prevented use of any JavaScript libraries.

I chose to use this project to practice Object Oriented Design and Object Oriented Programming, including the ES6 Class keyword, which may cause this application to fail in Internet Explorer.

This game can be controlled with keyboard, click, or touch controls. The interface is designed to play well on a phone in landscape mode.
